When transferring larger files, the server-client processes take a considerable amount
of time to transfer the data. In my program I recorded the time taken(seconds) to 
transfer files of different sizes(bytes).

10KB : 0.0037077 seconds
200KB : 0.0417547 seconds
1MB : 0.253561 seconds
10MB : 1.82835 seconds
50MB : 7.35109 seconds
100MB : 14.1602 seconds

If we were to plot this data with size vs time, we could observe how rapidly the time
increases as we start to transfer significantly large files. The main bottleneck here
occurs when are are using the cread() function to read from the channel into the buffer. 
This happens  because the buffer size is by default 256 bytes and isn't capable of storing
much of the data from the file at once, so we have to continously read data in chunks 
until we have read all of the data. However, even if we were to increase the size of 
the buffer the time taken would be considerably large, since copying from/to memory
is an expensive task.
